Version 2.9

- When a controller throws an exception, exit the
  message handling loop as soon as possible, to avoid
  being caught in an infinite loop handling messages
  generated by a broken controller.

Version 2.8

- When there are namespace collisions whilst
  loading controllers, clearly indicate
  the filenames of both DLLs that share a namespace.

Version 2.7

- Strengthened error checking in controller loading,
  particularly verifying that controllers do not
  attempt to use the same namespace as each other or
  the demonstration controllers.

Version 2.6

- Log information about exceptions when controllers crash.

Version 2.5

- Improved choice of widgets in Properties dialog
- Improved handling of directories set in Properties
- Reformatting Changes.txt

Version 2.4

- Added Properties settings.

Version 2.3

- Critters occasionally appeared at Point(0, 0) immediately after launch due
  to collision and broken Bounceback(). Fixed.

Version 2.2

- CritterLoader now sends log messages to Critterworld.Log instead of Console.

Version 2.1

- Fix possible NPE in Critter.
- Dead CritterS could send messages to controller. Fixed.

Version 2.0

- CritterWorld 2 begins.

Version 0.1.11

- Re-instate Configuration, since it won't be part of the assignment.
- Added "poop".
- Heavy refactoring.

Version 0.1.10

- Updated for assignment for 2012. Changed ICritterFactory to ICritterFactory2 and changed use of ICritterBrain to use
  of the virtual base class CritterBrainCore.

Version 0.1.9

- Minor tweaks to Critter and World to simplify birth
  and tracking of DLL file name.

Version 0.1.8

- In VisibleObject.PumpEvents(), Thread.Sleep(0) changed
  to Thread.Sleep(1) to reduce CPU burn.

Version 0.1.7

- Better error trapping in World.LoadCritters().

Version 0.1.6

- Added deadCritters.Clear() to World.StopWorld() so that dead critter
  display resets when level changes.

Version 0.1.5

- Critter death now shuts down Critter timers.
- VisibleObject message pump thread now set to below normal priority,
  hopefully to improve responsiveness.

Version 0.1.4

- Logging improved; supports multiple message levels and assocated log file, 
  etc.
- Crashed CritterS now immediately killed off.

Version 0.1.3

- Reverted changes to ICritter interface.  All 'Point point' changed to
  'int x, int y'.

Version 0.1.2

- Re-instated increase in energy consumption when moving fast,
  in Critter.
- Re-wrote IsCollisionWithTerrain(Point, Point, radius) in VisibleMovableObject.  
  It might work, it might not.  Try it.
- ICritter interface: All 'int x, int y' changed to 'Point point'.
  Critter changed correspondingly.
- Added scrolling "news" marquee to main form.
- Added "competition mode" to CritterWorld.  Start up as 'CritterWorld -?'
  to see options.
- Created CritterWorldRunner and CritterWorldControlPanel to handle remote 
  operation via shared folder.  If you set CritterWorldRunner to be the default
  startup project, it will launch CritterWorld in competition mode but
  note that it can only be shut down explicitly via "Debug | Stop Debugging"
  or via CritterWorldControlPanel.  CritterWorldControlPanel can be used to 
  start and stop CritterWorld and/or CritterWorldRunner.
- Critter stats display re-engineered, mainly in CritterWorldForm, Critter,
  and World.
- Leaderboard (high scores) added via Leaderboard, World, and CritterWorldForm.
  Note file name defined in World, to provide persistence.

Version 0.1.1

- Added Version class and altered title on CritterWorldForm to
  show product name and version.
- Fixed collision code (mainly IsTouching and related methods)
  in VisibleObject and World.
- Included Background01.png, Background02.png and BackgroundBase.png
  in CritterWorld resources.  These were mistakenly excluded.
- Fixed background image loading in WorldPanel.
- GetDestination now returns empty Rectangle if there is no Goal,
  instead of returning Rectangle(-1, -1, -1, -1).
- Changed Competition definition.
- Thread.Sleep(0) in SpriteEnvironment.Renderer() changed to invoke
  Thread.Sleep(1) at intervals in order to to improve UI responsiveness.
- Logged error messages now include minimal stack trace.
- ICritterBrain method 'void NotifyBumped(IOtherCritter otherCritter)'
  changed to 'void NotifyBumped(IWorldObject otherCritter)' to fix
  illegal cast exceptions thrown in Critter.NotifyBumped() and
  to allow future richer interactions between Critters and
  environment.
- DemoCritter project and DemoCritterBrain* updated to allow
  for above.
- Added alpha channel to demo4_1.png and demo4_2.png.
- 'Energy' handling simplified and fixed in VisibleMovableObject 
  and Critter.
- Critters used to lose energy faster as they got older (theoretically),
  but this added conceptual complexity.  Removed from 
  World.UpdateAges().
- Removed startTime from Critter.  Not used.
- DeadReason added to VisibleObject; displayed in Critter.DisplayEnergy.
  Set via Die().
- Critter stats display re-written; no Refresh() required.
- Timer, FPS, etc. removed from CritterWorldForm.  No longer needed.
- Critter "feeding" moved from Critter to Food, to simplify both and
  eliminate multiple feedings due to repeated collision detections.
- Numerous minor tweaks.
